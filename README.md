# Test Introduction

At Awarri, we are at the forefront of developing AI solutions that are transforming how machine learning teams operate globally. Our commitment to democratizing frontier technology in Africa is embodied in our cutting-edge tools and systems. As part of our ongoing mission, we are enhancing our cloud-based annotation system, which plays a pivotal role in AI model development across various sectors, including life sciences, robotics, and manufacturing.

This assessment focuses on the setup and customization of the open source Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT). The task will demonstrate your expertise in cloud architectures, containerization, and AI modules, crucial for enhancing our AI annotation capabilities.

## Task Overview

As part of the Awarri team, you are assigned to set up and customize our in house annotation and dataset management tools. This task is crucial for demonstrating your skills in cloud infrastructure and AI module integration.

### Tasks

#### 1. CVAT Setup
- **Clone and Setup**: Clone the CVAT repository from GitHub and set up a local instance using Docker. [CVAT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opencv/cvat) for more information.
- **Functionality Check**: Ensure that the CVAT tool is functioning correctly after setup.

#### 2. Enable Server-less AI Modules (SAM Module)
- **Integration**: Integrate the Server-less AI Modules (SAM Module) into your CVAT setup.
- **Highlight Capabilities**: Demonstrate the enhanced AI capabilities of the tool with the SAM module enabled.

#### 3. Custom Branding
- **Branding Design**: Implement new branding on the CVAT's front page loading screen. The design should reflect Awarri's values and ethos.

#### 4. Live Demonstration
- **Preparation**: Prepare for a live demonstration that showcases the entire setup, customization, and functionality of the CVAT system.
- **Execution**: Conduct this demonstration via a Zoom call with the test reviewer. Ensure to highlight the system's operation with the SAM module and the custom branding you've implemented.

## Deliverables & Submission

- **1 Hour Live Demonstration**: Present a live demonstration of the setup and operational system during a scheduled Zoom call.
- **Verbal Explanation**: Provide a detailed verbal explanation during the demo, covering the CVAT setup process, integration of the SAM module, and the custom branding implementation.
- **Functionality Showcase**: Demonstrate the system's functionality, emphasizing any added features or capabilities you have incorporated.

---

**Note:** The live demonstration is a critical component of this task, providing an opportunity to display your technical skills and understanding of the system in a practical scenario.

# Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Effectiveness and Organization of Your Live Demonstration
- **Preparation**: How well-prepared and structured is your demonstration?
- **Presentation Skills**: Effectiveness in communicating and demonstrating the setup and features.
- **Time Management**: Efficient use of time during the demonstration to cover all aspects.

### 2. Clarity, Aesthetics, and Functionality of CVAT Setup and Customizations
- **Technical Execution**: Accuracy and precision in setting up and customizing the CVAT.
- **Design Aspects**: The visual appeal and professional representation of the custom branding.
- **Functionality**: The overall performance of the CVAT with your customizations, including the integration of the SAM module.

### 3. Rationale Behind Your Approach
- **Decision Making**: Understanding the choices made during the setup and customization process.
- **Problem-Solving**: Ability to address challenges or potential issues during the implementation.
- **Innovation**: Creativity and originality in your approach to the task.

### 4. Depth and Clarity of Explanations and Responses During the Demo
- **Communication Skills**: Clear and concise explanations of the steps taken and features implemented.
- **Knowledge Demonstration**: Depth of understanding shown in your explanations and responses to questions.
- **Engagement**: Ability to engage with the reviewer, responding effectively to questions and feedback.

---

**Note:** The evaluation will be holistic, considering not only the technical aspects of the task but also your ability to communicate effectively and demonstrate a deep understanding of the tools and processes involved.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Are specific environment or version requirements needed for Docker and CVAT?

- **Answer:** While there are no strict version requirements for Docker, it is essential to use stable and compatible versions of both. This ensures that the setup runs smoothly and is free from compatibility issues. For CVAT you should attempt to use the lastest stable version at https://github.com/opencv/cvat

### 2. Can I use additional libraries or packages?

- **Answer:** Yes, you are encouraged to use any additional libraries or packages that complement and enhance the setup and functionality of CVAT. The choice of libraries and packages should align with the goals of the task and should contribute positively to the overall setup and operation.

### 3. What if the task exceeds the expected time frame?

- **Answer:** If the task takes longer than anticipated, you should use the live demonstration to outline any remaining work or future enhancements you might consider. This includes discussing any incomplete aspects of the setup, potential improvements, or additional features that could be added in the future. Your ability to plan and prioritize, as well as to anticipate future developments, is an important part of the evaluation.
